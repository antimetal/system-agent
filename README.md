## License

This project uses split licensing:

- **Userspace components** (`/cmd`, `/internal`, `/pkg`): PolyForm Shield
- **eBPF programs** (`/ebpf`): GPL-2.0-only

The eBPF programs must be GPL-licensed due to their use of GPL-only kernel helper functions. 
This is a standard practice in the industry for projects that include both userspace and eBPF code.

If you are an end user, broadly you can do whatever you want with the userspace code under PolyForm Shield.
See the License FAQ for more information about PolyForm licensing.
